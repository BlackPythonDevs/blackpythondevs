# How to suggest a team, workgroup, or workshop

To suggest a new team, workgroup, or workshop, ensure you can lead the team or workgroup, and have the necessary experience to organize the workshop. Then send an email proposal to `leadership@blackpythondevs.com`, detailing the responsibilities of the new team or workgroup. If you are suggesting a workshop, the proposal should include the rationale for it.

After receiving your email proposal, the [BPD leadership](https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/blackpythondevs/tree/main/roles/leadership) will review it and send you an email informing you about their decision.
