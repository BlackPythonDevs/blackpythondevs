# How to request volunteer travel support

If you are volunteering with Black Python Devs at a conference, you may be eligible for travel support of up to **$500 USD** under the [Volunteer Travel Support Policy](/policies/volunteer-travel-support.md).

## Steps

1. Confirm that you are an approved volunteer for the event.
2. Contact the Regional Executor responsible for the event's location and request written approval for your travel expenses **before** incurring any costs.
3. Once approved, follow the [Paying for things and seeking reimbursement](/policies/paying-for-things-and-getting-reimbursed.md) guide to submit your expenses and receive reimbursement.
