# Frequently asked questions

If you are working with Black Python Devs, you may receive one or more of these questions. This document guides you on how to respond to such frequently asked questions.

## Is this community only for black people?

The Black Python Devs community is meant to extend the Python community to black and colored Pythonistas of all skill levels.

We understand that [blackness and colorism are constructs that are often used to segregate or diminish individuals and don't always match a person's self-identity](https://blackpythondevs.com/2024-05-22-why-we-use-colored-and-coloured/). We allow people from all walks of life to join our community.

## Is this community welcome to everyone?

The only people who are asked to leave the community are those who join with the intent of violating our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/.maintainers?tab=coc-ov-file#readme).

## Is this a religious or politically backed group?

No, this community doesn't align with any religious or political group. People of all religions and political beliefs are allowed to join and participate in accordance with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/.maintainers?tab=coc-ov-file#readme).

## Where is Black Python Devs based?

We are registered as a non-profit in the United States of America and as a fiscal sponsor of the GNOME Foundation.

## Does Black Python Devs have resources for beginners?

While we have partnerships that give us access to beginner resources, we currently do not author any content that would allow us to support beginners with a learning program.

## Does GNOME run this community?

No, GNOME doesn't run the Black Python Devs community. GNOME is our fiscal host, which means they help us in issuing payments following our programs and policies.

If we attempt to spend money that we don't have or spend money in a way that violates our non-profit status in the United States, GNOME can come in to prevent us from doing this.

## Does Black Python Devs meet in person?

We are currently working on making this possible. Be sure to keep an eye on our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pro/black-python-devs/) page.

## Does Black Python Devs support existing meetups?

The Black Python Devs community supports meetups that are related to what we do. We aim to support local Python leaders in attracting more black and colored Pythonistas of all skill levels.

## Does Black Python Devs support conferences?

Yes, Black Python Devs works with conferences to help make them safer, more accessible, and equitable to black and colored people. This support can be in the form of monetary support to help them attend the event. This is often determined based on the location and size of the event, the organizing team and their needs, and the opportunities available to provide meaningful support to the black and colored people in the area.

## Does Black Python Devs send money to developers to attend conferences?

Currently, Black Python Devs doesn't send money directly to individuals unless they are awarded a grant related to a Black Python Devs event. When possible, Black Python Devs works with third-party vendors to ensure awards are used in accordance with the grant plans.

## Does the Black Python Devs community work in all countries?

As Black Python Devs is registered as a US non-profit, we are barred from working with some [countries and entities based on the US Sanction System](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).
