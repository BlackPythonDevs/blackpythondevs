## Tonal Marks (Àwọn iṣẹ́lẹ̀ àwọn irò-ọ̀rọ̀)
Yoruba is a tonal language, meaning that the pitch at which a word is pronounced can change its meaning. There are three primary tones:

- **High Tone**: Indicated by an acute accent (´), e.g., á
- **Mid Tone**: Usually unmarked, e.g., a
- **Low Tone**: Indicated by a grave accent (`), e.g., à

### Examples (Àfiwé tai àpẹẹrẹ)
- **High Tone**: á, é, í, ó, ú
- **Mid Tone**: a, e, i, o, u
- **Low Tone**: à, è, ì, ò, ù

## Syllable Structure
Yoruba syllables typically follow a consonant-vowel (CV) structure, but can also be V, N (nasal consonant), CVV, or CVN.

### Examples (Àfiwé tai àpẹẹrẹ)
- CV: ba, de, fi
- V: a, e, o
- N: m, n
- CVV: bọọ, dii
- CVN: bàń, gọ́n

## Grammar 

### Nouns
Nouns in Yoruba do not inflect for number or gender. Plurality is often indicated contextually or with numerals.

### Pronouns (Àwọn orúkọ-àpẹẹrẹ)
Yoruba pronouns change based on their function in the sentence.

| English | Subject | Object | Possessive |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| I       | mo      | mi     | temi       |
| You (singular) | o | ọ     | tire       |
| He/She/It | ó     | òun    | tirẹ̀      |
| We      | àwa     | wa     | tawa       |
| You (plural) | ẹ̀yin | yin  | tire       |
| They    | wọ́n    | wọ́n   | tiwọn      |

### Verbs (àwọn òrò-ìṣe)
Verbs in Yoruba do not conjugate according to tense. Instead, tense is indicated by particles before the verb.

- **Present**: n + verb (e.g., n lọ - "is going")
- **Past**: ti + verb (e.g., ti lọ - "has gone")
- **Future**: máa + verb (e.g., máa lọ - "will go")

### Examples (Àfiwé tai àpẹẹrẹ)
- Present: Mo n lọ (I am going)
- Past: Mo ti lọ (I have gone)
- Future: Mo máa lọ (I will go)

## Punctuation (àmì ọ̀rọ̀ tabi àmì óhun)
Yoruba uses standard punctuation marks, but there are specific rules for their usage, especially concerning tone marks and vowel elongation.

## Common Phrases
- **Hello**: Ẹ n lẹ
- **Good morning**: Ẹ káàárọ̀
