# Record of Supporters

We keep an annual record of our supporters to track their contributions over time. To protect their privacy, we only share their names in public.

## Update/Removal of individuals

Upon request in writing (via email to leadership@blackpythondevs.com), individuals can have one or more instances of their name updated or removed from the public record files. Considering the file is kept in version control, information cannot be completely deleted. To not have your name included please mark to be anonymous at time of donation.

Record keeping is done using [CommitChange](https://commitchange.com). Information in CommitChange can be updated but should not be removed.

## Adding a name to the list of Supporters

The supporters list will be updated at the end of the year using the end-of-year export feature in CommitChange.

## Foundational Supporters listed on the website

If a donor donates over $200 in one calendar year, their name will be added to the website as a foundational supporter. This information is updated monthly using [CommitChange](https://commitchange.com) our payment processor.

Foundational Supporters are listed from the month after they reach $200 donated in that calendar year and the following year.
