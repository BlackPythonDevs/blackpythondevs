# Record of Supporters

We keep an annual record of our supporters to track their contributions over time. To protect their privacy, we only share their names in public.

## Updating or Removing Supporter Information

You can request updates or removal of your name from our public records by sending a written request via email to **leadership@blackpythondevs.com**.

However, since we manage these records using version control, we cannot completely delete all information. So if you prefer not to have your name appear in our public records, please mark it as `anonymous` at the time of your donation.

We use [CommitChange](https://commitchange.com) for record-keeping. While we can update information in `CommitChange`, we cannot remove it entirely.

## Adding a name to the list of Supporters

The supporters list will be updated at the end of the year using the end-of-year export feature in CommitChange.

## Foundational Supporters listed on the website

If a donor donates over $200 in one calendar year, their name will be added to the website as a foundational supporter. This information is updated monthly using [CommitChange](https://commitchange.com) our payment processor.

Foundational Supporters are listed from the month after they reach $200 donated in that calendar year and the following year.
