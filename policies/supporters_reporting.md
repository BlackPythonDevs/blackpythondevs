# Record of supporters

We keep an annual record of our supporters to track their contributions over time. To protect their privacy, we only share their names in public.

## Updating or removing supporter information

You can request updates or removal of your name from our public records by sending a written request via email to `leadership@blackpythondevs.com`.

However, since we manage these records using version control, we cannot completely delete all information. So if you prefer not to have your name appear in our public records, please mark it as `anonymous` at the time of your donation.

We use [CommitChange](https://commitchange.com) for record-keeping. While we can update information in `CommitChange`, we cannot remove it entirely.

## Adding a name to the list of supporters

The supporters’ list is annually updated using the end-of-year export feature in `CommitChange`.

## Foundational supporters

Donors who contribute over $200 in a calendar year will be recognized as Foundational Supporters, and their names will be featured on our website. This information is updated monthly through our payment processor, `CommitChange`.

Foundational Supporters are listed starting from the month they reach $200 in donations for that calendar year and remain listed through the following year.
