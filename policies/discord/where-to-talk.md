# The best place to chat in Discord

People often ask: “Where’s the best place to talk about…?”

We’ve been asking the same thing. Right now, our answer is simple: _the community figures it out, and we support what works_.

So what does that mean? It means there’s no perfect answer. Is GitHub a good place? The answer to this depends on what you want to do. GitHub is where issues and PR updates show up. It helps reduce noise and keeps people informed.

That said, we also have a `#contributors-wanted` channel in Discord. The channel is for sharing projects that need help.

## Start in `#general` when in doubt

The `#general` channel in Discord is the home for all kinds of conversation. You can share your excitement, ask a question, bring up a community topic—it all fits.

Not sure where something belongs? Start in `#general`. Our rule is that you _won't be yelled at for putting something in `#general`_.

This means that a lot of the conversation happens in `#general`. So, we encourage you to have conversations in the channel.

## When is `#general` not okay?

Two things don’t belong in #general:

- direct solicitation
- aggressive self-promotion

### No direct soliciting

We care about a lot of projects. Black Python Devs is a US non-profit. This means that a part of what we do is raise money. So we do our best to keep fundraising efforts internal to the community at an absolute minimum. This is because we don't want the community to feel like a place where you are constantly being asked for money. We will only share campaigns we're doing once they launch and **how folks can share the campaign**. There is no expectation for anyone to pay for being in _Black Python Devs_ or taking part in Black Python Devs events on the Discord.

That message gets skewed when members come and ask for money. Not everyone is in a position where being asked for money is something they can easily say "Yes" or "No". That kind of pressure can make people uncomfortable in the community.

### Aggressive self promotion

If you wrote something that you're excited about or you've hit an amazing milestone in your career, we want you to share that excitement with us. `#general` can be a great place for it.

If you're on a content grind, this is not your a place for you. 

We understand that people join the community for different reasons, but **_it's not our job to make anyone famous_**. Our goal is to make the Python community a place where all  Black Pythonistas of all skill levels don't simply belong, but lead and thrive. This means that everyone should feel welcome to chat. So the BPD community is not the place to build your clout.

## Posting of unpaid Jobs

Please don't post unpaid positions in any of our Discord channels. While internships are welcome, we prohibit posting positions offering equity-only compensation.

This is because equity-based compensation can be problematic. While it has the potential for significant rewards if the startup succeeds, it often involves working without guaranteed future pay. The arrangement may suit certain stages of life, but it's generally inappropriate for most people in our community, who seek paid opportunities.

## Using our Discord channels

You can use our Discord in the following manner:

- If you want to have a message-like conversation, start a thread.
- If you want to have a longer discussion, use the `community-discussion` channel.
- If it's related to a conversation happening in a channel or to a specific group, then link and continue the conversation in the channel. 
- If you think a channel should be created for it, ask `@mods` or `@BPDLeaders`. The worst they will say is either "No" or "That exists already". In most cases, they'll just make the channel.
