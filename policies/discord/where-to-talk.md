# The Best Place to Chat in the Discord...

We get asked often "Where is the best place to talk about..."

We've been trying to figure this out ourselves and currently our policy is _the community will figure it out and we will do our best to support it_.

Okay but what does that mean...

This means that there isn't really a wrong answer. Is `#github` the best place to have that discussion, kinda yes and no.  The `#github` channel was actually where issues and PR updates are relayed to the community. This is in part to reduce the number of places to check but also so people can see new issues. 

That said we also have `#contributors-wanted` where maintainers can share open source projects that are looking for maintainers. But until writing this I totally forgot that it existed and I've been putting things in `#general`. 

## When in doubt start in `#general`

General is meant to be the home for all kinds of conversation. Whether you're excited about a new event or meetup or something in the community is happening and you want our opinion about it.

If you don't know where something should go, our rule is you _usually won't be yelled at for putting something in `#general`_.

Obviously, this means that a lot of conversation should be happening in `#general` (we encourage you to have conversations.)

This is where discords technology should be used.

- If you want to have a conversation on a message start a thread.
- If you want something to have a longer discussion on it, use the `community-discussion`
- If it's related to a conversation happening in a channel or to a specific group, then link and continue the conversation in the channel. 
- If you think a channel should be created for it, simply ask `@mods` or `@BPDLeaders`. The worst they will say is either "No" or "That exists already". In many cases they'll just make the channel.

## When is `#general` not okay

The only thing that is generally not okay is solicitation or **aggresive** self-promotion.

### No Direct Soliciting

There are a lot of projects that we all care about. Black Python Devs is a US Non-Profit. This means that a part of what we do is raise money. That being, said we do our best to keep fundraising efforts internally to the community at an absolute minimum. This is because we truly don't want the community to feel like a place where you are constantly being asked for money. In fact, we will only share campaigns we're doing once they launch and **how folks can share the campaign**. There is no expectation that anyone pay for being in _Black Python Devs_ or taking part of Black Python Devs events in the Discord.

That message gets skewed when members come and ask for money. Not everyone is in a position where being asked for money is something they can easily say "Yes" or "No". Whether the reasons are financial or cultural that pressure can cause people to not feel comfortable in the community.

### Aggressive Self Promotion

If you wrote something that you're excited about or you've hit an amazing milestone in your career, we want you to share that excitement with us. `#general` can be a great place for it. 

If you're on your #content-grind. This is not your channel. 

We understand that people join the community for different reasons. I've said this before and I'll stand on it. 

> Our job is to not make anyone _famous_. 
 
Our goal here is to make the Python Community a place where all  Black Pythonistas of all skill-levels don't simply belong, but lead and thrive. This means that everyone should feel welcome to chat and be encouraged that we are not only for celebrities. So if you came here to build your clout, it's not going to be the best place for that.

## Posting of Unpaid Jobs

Please do not post unpaid positions in any of our Discord channels. While internships are welcome, we prohibit posting positions offering equity-only compensation.

This is because equity-based compensation can be problematic. While it has the potential for significant rewards if the startup succeeds, it often involves working without guaranteed future pay. The arrangement may suit certain stages of life, but it's generally inappropriate for most people in our community, who seek paid opportunities.
