# Standards of content

## Making changes to this document

This is a living document. It is important that, as we develop into a larger community, we continue to grow how we think about how our content can reach more and more Black Python devs and supporters.

**Proposed changes to this document are encouraged.** If you have a suggestion that could improve how we communicate as an org, please file an [issue](https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/.maintainers/issues/new).

## Purpose of this document

This document is meant to be a guideline for content that is created on behalf of Black Python Devs.

This pertains to written as well as audio and video content.

## Content is not meant to be hateful, but not afraid to address difficult topics

It is a reality that the lives of Black people around the world are, in many cases, elevated based on current events.

Black, colored developers are unable to minimize their blackness in the eyes of the world, therefore, we invite our platform to share those experiences from time-to-time.

Our content is held to the same Code of Conduct and is subject to review by our leadership. 

## No code-switching but explanations are encouraged

We want to ensure that our content is readable, but doesn't take away from the message being presented.

We ask that cultural references be documented so that others can learn and enjoy with the same context.

## Own your masters approach to signal amplification

One of our core foundations is to _own your masters_. This references the ability to control how your content is distributed.

Black Python Devs wants to be an amplifier, but not an owner of your content. We'll only ask that you contribute content if it directly relates to Black Python Devs. Any time that we promote your content, it should always link to your original source.

Lastly, for all content you create on behalf of Black Python Devs, you have the right to request its removal.
