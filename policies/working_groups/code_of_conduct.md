# Code of conduct working group

The **Code of conduct working group** helps in keeping our community safe, respectful, and welcoming. This team is responsible for reviewing and enforcing our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/.github?tab=coc-ov-file#readme) across all Black Python Devs platforms. The platforms include Discord, social media, and anywhere BPD members interact on behalf of the community.

## Current code of conduct working group members

- Chris Achinga

- review our Code of Conduct and make any necessary changes
- enforce our Code of Conduct across all members and communities, including:
    - Black Python Devs Discord

    - members acting on behalf of or representing Black Python Devs
    - interaction between two or more Black Python Devs members outside of the community that could negatively impact the community and the well-being of others in the community
    - action of Black Python Devs leadership or a community leader that violates our Code of Conduct that endangers the community or its members

## Becoming a member

When there’s an opening on the Code of conduct working group, you can fill out the  [request form](https://forms.gle/cqkvBPhy77YNtDLw5) to express your interest in joining.

After you submit the form, current members will review your application and make a final decision in collaboration with the Board liaison.

## Removing a member

A member of the group may be removed if:

- that member is found to be in violation of the Code of Conduct, and disciplinary action is required
- that member doesn't consistently engage in the activities of the Code of conduct working group
- that member elects to resign from the group

## Reporting an incident

You can file a report if you believe that the Code of Conduct has been violated, even if you are unsure or were not directly involved in the incident.

Reporting a Code of Conduct violation takes courage and shows a strong commitment to building a respectful, safe, and inclusive community. Your voice matters. Speaking up helps everyone feel seen, heard, and valued. When you report misconduct, you protect not just yourself but the entire community.

Your report will be recorded and first shared with the Code of conduct working group and the Code of conduct liaison. If a consensus cannot be met, the Global executor, Regional executors, and Vice regional executors will be notified.

If determined that corrective or remedial action is necessary, we will notify the alleged offender while keeping the identity of the reporting person anonymous.

## Handling incident report

The Code of conduct working group is expected to acknowledge the report in a timely manner and reach out to the reporting party. They should also indicate that the event has been documented and the group is working to determine the appropriate course of action.

The incident should be discussed in the #code-of-conduct-working-group text and voice channels  of the Black Python Devs Discord channel. These conversations must stay in these channels to keep the anonymity of the parties.

If a member of the Code of conduct working group is involved in the reported incident, they should recuse themselves from the discussion. Here, the Global executor, Regional executors, and Vice regional executors will act to determine the appropriate course of action.

The group will keep the following in mind when handling an incident:

- blending cultures can be difficult, but showing respect, compassion, and empathy is not.
- appropriate course of action should be based on the intent behind the action
- act fairly toward all parties, and protect the anonymity of the reporting individual.
- failure to comply with corrective or remedial actions will not be tolerated and may result in more severe action

### Corrective action

Corrective action is deemed necessary if it's determined that a Code of Conduct violation indeed happened.

If the Code of Conduct working group decides that action is necessary, it will take the form of either corrective or remedial actions.

Examples of corrective actions include:

- a verbal and recorded warning
- permanent suspension from our community channels
- removal from leadership position

### Remedial action

Remedial action is non-disciplinary. It aims to clarify the Code of Conduct or address a member’s behavior that, while not a clear violation, could be misunderstood or seem inappropriate.

This action is taken when a cultural or communication-related misunderstanding occurs, and clarification is needed.

Examples of remedial actions include:

- a clarifying conversation
- updating or adding relevant policies to the Code of Conduct
