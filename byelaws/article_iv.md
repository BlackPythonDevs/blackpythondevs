All incidents shall be discussed exclusively in the #code-of-conduct-working-group text and voice channels of the Black Python Devs Discord server to maintain the anonymity of all parties.

If a member of the Code of Conduct Working Group is involved in a reported incident, that member shall recuse themselves from all related discussions. In such cases, the Global Executor, Regional Executors, and Vice Regional Executors shall determine the appropriate course of action.

The Working Group shall consider the following principles when handling incidents:
